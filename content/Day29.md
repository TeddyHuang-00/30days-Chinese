# How to make a zero-shot learning text classifier using Hugging Face and Streamlit

In today's challenge, [Charly Wargnier](https://twitter.com/DataChaz) will walk us through the process of developing a zero-shot learning text classifier using Hugging Face and Streamlit.

## Introduction

Hey Streamliters!

Today I'm excited to have the opportunity to contribute to the 30DaysofStreamlit challenge via this hands-on tutorial! ðŸŽˆ

## What are we building?

We will create a zero-shot learning text classifier using Hugging Face's API inference and Distilbart!

You will have the mighty power to classify keyphrases on-the-fly, fast, and without pre ML training!

Create classifying labels, paste your keyphrases, and you're off!

You can set these labels anything, e.g.:

- Positive, Negative and Neutral for sentiment analysis
- Angry, Happy, Emotional for emotion analysis
- Navigational, Transactional, Informational for intent classification purposes
- Your product range  (bags, shoes, boots etc.)

You decide! 

Excited? Let's dive in!
