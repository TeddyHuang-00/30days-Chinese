# Spin up a cloud development environment

### GitPod
To spin up a development environment on the cloud, we can use [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and this can be done simply by clicking on the following link:
- Try it ðŸ‘‰ https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit101/

As you can see from the URL above, a GitHub repo URL is appended after `https://gitpod.io/#/` which essentially allow GitPod to spin up a development environment using instructions contained within the GitHub repo URL (namely in the `requirements.txt` file that specifically lists the Python libraries to install).

> Note: There are other similar cloud development environment such as:
> - [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-up-your-python-project-for-codespaces)
> - [Replit](https://replit.com/)
> - [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
