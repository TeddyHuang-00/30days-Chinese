# How to use API by building the Bored API app

The Bored API app suggests fun things for you to do when you are bored!

Technically, it also demonstrates the usage of APIs from within a Streamlit app.

## Demo app

## Code
Here's how to implement the Bored-API app:
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title('üèÄ Bored API app')

st.sidebar.header('Input')
selected_type = st.sidebar.selectbox('Select an activity type', ["education", "recreational", "social", "diy", "charity", "cooking", "relaxation", "music", "busywork"])

suggested_activity_url = f'http://www.boredapi.com/api/activity?type={selected_type}'
json_data = requests.get(suggested_activity_url)
suggested_activity = json_data.json()

c1, c2 = st.columns(2)
with c1:
  with st.expander('About this app'):
    st.write('Are you bored? The **Bored API app** provides suggestions on activities that you can do when you are bored. This app is powered by the Bored API.')
with c2:
  with st.expander('JSON data'):
    st.write(suggested_activity)
    
st.header('Suggested activity')
st.info(suggested_activity['activity'])

col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
  st.metric(label='Number of Participants', value=suggested_activity['participants'], delta='')
with col2:
  st.metric(label='Type of Activity', value=suggested_activity['type'].capitalize(), delta='')
with col3:
  st.metric(label='Price', value=suggested_activity['price'], delta='')
```

## Line-by-line explanation
The very first thing to do when creating a Streamlit app is to start by importing the `streamlit` library as `st` and the `requests` library like so:
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
```

The app's title is displayed via `st.title`:
```python
st.title('üèÄ Bored API app')
```

Next, we'll accept user input on the **activity type** by means of the `st.selectbox` command:
```python
st.sidebar.header('Input')
selected_type = st.sidebar.selectbox('Select an activity type', ["education", "recreational", "social", "diy", "charity", "cooking", "relaxation", "music", "busywork"])
```

The selected activity mentioned above is then appended to the URL via an f-string, which is then used to retrieve the resulting JSON data: 
```python
suggested_activity_url = f'http://www.boredapi.com/api/activity?type={selected_type}'
json_data = requests.get(suggested_activity_url)
suggested_activity = json_data.json()
```

Here, we'll display information about the app and the JSON data via the `st.expander` command.
```python
c1, c2 = st.columns(2)
with c1:
  with st.expander('About this app'):
    st.write('Are you bored? The **Bored API app** provides suggestions on activities that you can do. This app is powered by the Bored API.')
with c2:
  with st.expander('JSON data'):
    st.write(suggested_activity)
```

We'll then display a suggested activity like so:
```python
st.header('Suggested activity')
st.info(suggested_activity['activity'])
```

Finally, we'll also display the accompanying information of the suggested activity such as the `Number of Participants`, `Type of Activity` and `Price`.
```python
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
  st.metric(label='Number of Participants', value=suggested_activity['participants'], delta='')
with col2:
  st.metric(label='Type of Activity', value=suggested_activity['type'].capitalize(), delta='')
with col3:
  st.metric(label='Price', value=suggested_activity['price'], delta='')
```
