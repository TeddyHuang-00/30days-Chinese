# Building your first Streamlit app

## Fire up your IDE

Fire up your IDE whether it be Atom, VS Code or even a cloud IDE such as GitPod or GitHub.dev.

Create a file called `streamlit_app.py`

## Entering your first lines of code

To the newly created file, enter the following lines of code:

```
import streamlit as st

st.write('Hello world!')
```

Save the file.

## Fire up the command line terminal

To the terminal, enter the following:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

A browser window should pop-up showing the newly created Streamlit app.

**Congratulations!** You have just created your first Streamlit app!
